Ticket Status Progression
-------------

As noted in the (Coding Practice)[{% post_url 2022-09-01-Coding-Practice %}] section, adopting to a school of thought on how things are done will make
everyone work almost at the same pace and with the same mindset, making everyone faster and productive.

The ticket progression is as follows:

1. To Do
2. In Progress
3. In Review
  * PH
  * JP
4. Done


Peer Review & Pull Request
-------------

No code pushed into the repository should ever be merged into branches deemed protected such as 'main', 'prod', 'staging', etc.
until a peer, project lead, or project manager has reviewed and tested the code.
